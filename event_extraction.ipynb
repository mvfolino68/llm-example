We'll walk through building a practical tool that could be integrated into email assistants, chat applications, or productivity tools.\n",

        "* Understand prompt chaining for multi-step LLM workflows\n",
        "* Learn how to use Pydantic for structured LLM outputs\n",
        "* Build a complete, production-ready event extraction system\n",

        "* **Improved accuracy** - Each step has a clearer, more focused goal\n",
        "* **Better control** - You can add validation between steps\n",

        "1. First, we determine IF text contains a calendar event\n",
